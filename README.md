Breast_Cancer_Prediction: This Jupyter Notebook contains the code and analysis for the assignment, specifically focusing on machine learning models for breast cancer prediction.

dataset: This directory contains the datasets used for breast cancer prediction. The selected dataset for this project is aimed at predicting breast cancer. You can find the dataset at the following link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data/.

Flask App: This directory includes the code and files for creating an application that predicts the likelihood of breast cancer. It consists of index.html, app.py, and style.css, which collectively form a web application for making breast cancer predictions.
